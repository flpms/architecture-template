# Architecture Template

A comprehensive architectural guide for building SvelteKit applications using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) via Markdown to guide AI assistants like GitHub Copilot through the development process.

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed architecture template that serves as context for AI-assisted development, preventing hallucinations and ensuring consistent architectural patterns throughout the development process.

## Key Features

- **Atomic Design Pattern** - Structured component hierarchy from atoms to templates
- **Functional Programming** - Pure functions and immutable data patterns
- **DDAU (Data Down, Actions Up)** - Clear data flow architecture
- **Test-Driven Development** - Comprehensive testing strategy with Vitest
- **SvelteKit + Svelte 5** - Modern reactive framework with latest features
- **Service Layer Architecture** - Centralized API handling and external integrations
- **Conventional Commits** - Structured commit messages with commitlint

## Usage

Use the `ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md` file as context when working with AI assistants to ensure:
- Consistent architectural decisions
- Proper implementation patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Maintainable and scalable code structure

## Getting Started

1. Copy the architecture template to your project
2. Customize it for your specific requirements
3. Use it as RAG context for AI-assisted development
4. Follow the TDD workflow outlined in the template
